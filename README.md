SimLive was developed at Esslingen University of Applied Science and is used for 3d simulations and digital twins.
The software is based on the finite element method and is suitable for simulating nonlinear mechanical systems in the field of statics and dynamics. This allows the analysis of complex physical phenomena such as deformation, vibration, damping, contact and friction.
By connecting the simulation with CAD models, a descriptive presentation is made possible. The software was developed for use in university teaching from a didactic perspective.
SimLive requires Java runtime environment (JRE) 64 bit.
